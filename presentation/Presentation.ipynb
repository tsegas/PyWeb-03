    "#### A WSGI Application\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we’ve learned a bit about the WSGI specification and how a WSGI application can get data that comes in via an HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a multi-page wsgi application.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will serve a small database of python books.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database (with a very simple api) can be found in `wsgi/bookdb.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We’ll need a listing page that shows the titles of all the books\n",
    "  * Each title will link to a details page for that book\n",
    "  * The details page for each book will display all the information and have a link back to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing our first wsgi app, do we see the name of the wsgi application script anywhere in the URL?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our wsgi application script, how many applications did we actually have?\n",
    "\n",
    "How are we going to serve different types of information out of a single application?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to write an app that will map our incoming request path to some code that can handle that request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called `dispatch`. There are many possible approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by designing this piece of our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `bookapp.py` from the `wsgi` folder. We’ll do our work here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wsgi environment gives us access to *PATH_INFO*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value is the URI from the client’s HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can design the URLs that our app will use to assist us in routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s declare that any request for / will map to the list page.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say that the URL for a book will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`http://localhost:8080/book/<id>`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Writing resolve_path\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s write a function, called resolve_path in our application file:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It should take the PATH_INFO value from environ as an argument.\n",
    "  * It should return the function that will be called.\n",
    "  * It should also return any arguments needed to call that function.\n",
    "  * This implies of course that the arguments should be part of the PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def resolve_path(path):\n",
    "    urls = [(r'^$', books),\n",
    "            (r'^book/(id[\\d]+)$', book)]\n",
    "    matchpath = path.lstrip('/')\n",
    "    for regexp, func in urls:\n",
    "        match = re.match(regexp, matchpath)\n",
    "        if match is None:\n",
    "            continue\n",
    "        args = match.groups([])\n",
    "        return func, args\n",
    "    # we get here if no url matches\n",
    "    raise NameError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to hook our new dispatch function into the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The path should be extracted from `environ`.\n",
    "  * The dispatch function should be used to get a function and arguments\n",
    "  * The body to return should come from calling that function with those arguments\n",
    "  * If an error is raised by calling the function, an appropriate response should be returned\n",
    "  * If the router raises a NameError, the application should return a 404 response\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def application(environ, start_response):\n",
    "    headers = [(\"Content-type\", \"text/html\")]\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        path = environ.get('PATH_INFO', None)\n",
    "        if path is None:\n",

    "        body = \"<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\"\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        headers.append(('Content-length', str(len(body))))\n",
    "        start_response(status, headers)\n",
    "        return [body.encode('utf8')]\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Test Your Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve got your script settled, run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python bookapp.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Building the Book List\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `books` should return an html list of book titles where each title is a link to the detail page for that book:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You’ll need all the ids and titles from the book database.\n",
    "  * You’ll need to build a list in HTML using this information\n",
    "  * Each list item should have the book title as a link\n",
    "  * The href for the link should be of the form /book/<id>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def books():\n",
    "    all_books = DB.titles()\n",
    "    body = ['<h1>My Bookshelf</h1>', '<ul>']\n",
    "    item_template = '<li><a href=\"/book/{id}\">{title}</a></li>'\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python bookapp.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then reload the root of your application:\n",

    "\n",
    "You should see a nice list of the books in the database. Do you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on a link to view the detail page. Does it load without error?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Showing Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step of course is to polish up those detail pages:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You’ll need to retrieve a single book from the database\n",
    "  * You’ll need to format the details about that book and return them as HTML\n",
    "  * You’ll need to guard against ids that do not map to books\n",
    "  * In this last case, what’s the right HTTP response code to send?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def book(book_id):\n",
    "    page = \"\"\"\n",

    "And your application is portable and sharable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should run equally well under any wsgi server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps for an app like this might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Create a shared full page template and incorporate it into your app\n",
    "  * Improve the error handling by emitting error codes other than 404 and 500\n",
    "  * Swap out the basic backend here with a different one, maybe a Web Service?\n",
    "  * Think about ways to make the application less tightly coupled to the pages it serves\n"
